# e3_table

This repository contains a spreadsheet dataset of known human and
yeast E3 protein ligases, each annotated with position specific
disorder and Anchor binding score predictions. The main goal of the
data was to find human equivalents of the San1 protein occurring in
yeast, which was recently found to have the ability to recognize
disordered substrates directly, without relying on a chaperone
protein. The disorder and anchor features are used to define a San1
similarity score, and the spreadsheets make it possible to sort the
entries by this score - and to recalculate San1 similarity scores for
different parameters settings. A small version of this file was
included with the publications of our paper. This larger file file
contains all data for each individual protein, and supports
recalculation of scores with different parameters.
